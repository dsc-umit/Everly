## Overview

The purpose of the project is to develop an intelligent voice assistant that keeps you company, entertains you, performs required tasks and also a therapist in the time of depression.
An increasing number of people are today falling with stress due to busy working & hectic work schedule or mismanaged lifestyle.Time and time again, we see people feeling overwhelmed because of the pressures that they face as part of modern life.
For some people, therapy can work to overcome this. Our voice assistant may provide a valuable separate or complementary option for tackling depressive symptoms. This AI virtual assistant can provide unprecedented accessibility by being available 24/7 at little to no cost.
